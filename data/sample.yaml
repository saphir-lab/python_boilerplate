# CSV file to be transformed.
# Provide full location to execute straight forward or empty string or null in order to be prompted during program execution.
Source:
  CSVFile: null
  CSVSeparator: ;

#  
Output:
  CSVLocation: null            # if not specified (null), Will be same location as CSV input. Note that folder should already exists.
  CSVSeparator: null           # if not specified (null), Will be same separator as CSV input.
  OverviewFile: false
  FileNameSeparator: _
  FileNameTimeStamp: true      # if true, add timestamp of execution at the end of filename.

# 
Transform:
  Algorithm: blake2s          # possible values: blake2s, blake2b, md5, sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, sha3_224, sha3_256, sha3_384, sha3_512, length, index (blake2s recommended).
  Salt: null                  # optional. Specify a string to be used as salt with the algorithm for all the fields you want to provide a hash.
  KeepOriginalValues: false   # for debugging purpose. To have 2 columns with both original and transformed value (when true, parameter KeepColumnName is then forced to false).
  KeepColumnName: true        # when false, will reflect in column names which one has been transformed & using which algorithm.
  Selection: All              # possible values : All, ExclusionList, InclusionList, ParameterFile.

###
#
SelectionParameters:
  # used with Scope: InclusionList - List of Fields Name (from header) that will be hashed, other will keep existing value.
  InclusionList:        
  - column1
  - column2
  # used with Scope: ExclusionList - List of Fields Name (from header) that will keep value. All others will be hashed.
  ExclusionList:        
  - column1
  - column2
  # used with Scope: ParameterFile - Explicit action (hash/keep original value) for every field of input file.
  # IMPORTANT NOTE: If a field name is present on input file but not on parameter file, this field will be dropped from output.
  ParameterFile:                        
    CSVFile: null           # prompted if not specified in this file.
    CSVSeparator: null      # if not specified (null), will be same separator as CSV input.
